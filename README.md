## 💡 Introduction
SimWorld is built on Unreal Engine 5 and offers core capabilities to meet the needs of modern agent development. It provides:
- Realistic, open-ended world simulation with accurate physics and language-based procedural generation.
- Rich interface for LLM/VLM agents, supporting multi-modal perception and natural language actions.
- Diverse and customizable physical and social reasoning scenarios, enabling systematic training and evaluation of complex agent behaviors like navigation, planning, and strategic cooperation.

## 🏗️ Architecture

</p>

**SimWorld** consists of three layers: 
- the Unreal Engine Backend, providing diverse and open-ended environments, rich assets and realistic physics simulation; 
- the Environment layer, supporting procedural city generation, language-driven scene editing, gym-like APIs for LLM/VLM agents and traffic simulation; 
- the Agent layer, enabling LLM/VLM agents to reason over multimodal observations and history while executing actions via an action planner;

SimWorld's architecture is designed to be modular and flexible, supporting an array of functionalities such as dynamic world generation, agent control, and performance benchmarking. The components are seamlessly integrated to provide a robust platform for **Embodied AI** and **Agents** research and applications.

## Setup
### Installation
+ Python Client
Make sure to use Python 3.10 or later.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/renjw02/SimWorld.git
cd SimWorld
conda create -n simworld python=3.10
conda activate simworld
pip install -e .
```

+ UE server
Download the SimWorld server executable from S3:

    + Windows. Download the [SimWorld Windows 64-bit Server (v0.1.0)](https://simworld-release.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/SimWorld-Win64-v0_1_0-Foundation.zip) and unzip it.
    + Linux. Download the [SimWorld Linux 64-bit Server (v0.1.0)](https://simworld-release.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/SimWorld-Linux-v0_1_0-Foundation.zip) and unzip it.

### Quick Start

We provide several examples of code in `scripts/`, showcasing how to use the basic functionalities of SimWorld, including city layout generation, traffic simulation, asset retrieval, and activity-to-actions. Please follow the examples to see how SimWorld works.

#### Configuration

SimWorld uses YAML-formatted configuration files for system settings. The default configuration files are located in the `./simworld/config` directory while user configurations are placed in the `./config` directory.

- `./simworld/config/default.yaml` serves as the default configuration file.
- `./config/example.yaml` is provided as a template for custom configurations.

Users can switch between different configurations by specifying a custom configuration file path through the `Config` class:

To set up your own configuration:

1. Create your custom configuration by copying the example template:
   ```bash
   cp ./config/example.yaml ./config/your_config.yaml
   ```

2. Modify the configuration values in `your_config.yaml` according to your needs

3. Load your custom configuration in your code:
   ```python
   from simworld.config import Config
   config = Config('path/to/your_config')    # use absolute path here
   ```

#### Simple Running Example

Once the SimWorld UE5 environment is running, you can connect from Python and control an in-world humanoid agent in just a few lines:

```python
from simworld.communicator.unrealcv import UnrealCV
from simworld.communicator.communicator import Communicator
from simworld.agent.humanoid import Humanoid
from simworld.utils.vector import Vector

# Connect to the running Unreal Engine instance via UnrealCV
ucv = UnrealCV()
comm = Communicator(ucv)

# Define your customized environment logic
class Env:
    def __init__(self, comm: Communicator, agent: Humanoid, target: Vector):
        self.comm = comm
        self.agent = agent
        self.target = target

    def reset(self):
        # Clear spawned objects
        self.comm.clear_env()
        
        # Blueprint path for the humanoid agent to spawn in the UE level
        agent_bp = "/Game/TrafficSystem/Pedestrian/Base_User_Agent.Base_User_Agent_C"
        
        # Initial spawn position and facing direction for the humanoid
        spawn_location = Vector(0, 0)
        spawn_forward = Vector(0, 1)
        agent = Humanoid(spawn_location, spawn_forward)
        
        # Spawn the humanoid agent in the Unreal world
        self.comm.spawn_agent(agent=agent, model_path=agent_bp)
        self.agent_name = self.comm.get_humanoid_name(self.agent.id)
        
        # Define a target position the agent is encouraged to move toward (example value)
        target = Vector(1000, 0)

    def step(self):
        self.comm.humanoid_step_forward(self.agent.id, 2.0)
        location = self.comm.unrealcv.get_location(self.agent_name)
        observation = self.comm.get_camera_observation(self.agent.camera_id, 'lit')
        reward = -distance(location, self.target)

        return observation, reward

# Create the environment wrapper
env = Env(comm, agent, target)
env.reset()

# Roll out a short trajectory
for _ in range(100):
    observation, reward = env.step()
    # Plug this into your RL loop / logging as needed
```
